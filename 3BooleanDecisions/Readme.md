Enter the grades example above. Modify the program so a student could get a 'D' if they score between 60 and 69. Also, modify the program to print a + or - after the letter grade based on the last digit of the score. If the last digit is between 0 and 2 then print a - after the grade. If the last digit is 7,8 or 9 then print a + after the grade. Otherwise don't print a + or - if the last digit is between 3 and 6. Change the output to print the student's grade.
